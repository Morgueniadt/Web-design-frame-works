        <!-- Introduction to Design Process -->
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>Welcome to the design process page for the Clear Path app. Below, you will find a detailed explanation of how we approached the app's design, starting from research and wireframing to prototyping and final design decisions. This journey helped us create a user-friendly and intuitive app focused on mental health and wellness.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Design Process Overview -->
        <div class="process-step">
            <h4>1. Research & Ideation</h4>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Our first step was to understand the needs of our target audience: individuals seeking mental health support. We conducted surveys, interviewed potential users, and studied existing mental health apps to understand their challenges and needs. Based on this research, we identified key features like mood tracking, journaling, and meditation that would benefit users the most.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Wireframes -->
        <div class="process-step">
            <h4>2. Wireframing</h4>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Next, we created wireframes to visualize the app's basic layout and flow. Wireframes allowed us to focus on the core structure and user interaction without worrying about colors and detailed design elements. Below is an example of the initial wireframe for the Clear Path app's main screen.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-box">
                <img src="images/wireframe-1.jpg" alt="Clear Path Wireframe" class="img-fluid" />
                <p><small>Initial Wireframe for the Main Screen</small></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- User Flow -->
        <div class="process-step">
            <h4>3. User Flow</h4>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>We created a user flow to define the steps a user would take within the app. This flow ensured that the user experience was seamless and intuitive, guiding the user from journaling to mood tracking to meditation, with easy navigation throughout the app.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-box">
                <img src="images/user-flow.jpg" alt="Clear Path User Flow" class="img-fluid" />
                <p><small>Clear Path App User Flow</small></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Design Iterations -->
        <div class="process-step">
            <h4>4. Design Iterations</h4>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Once the wireframes and user flow were in place, we moved on to the visual design phase. We experimented with different color schemes, typography, and iconography to create a calm and welcoming interface that would resonate with users seeking mental health support. The design went through several iterations based on feedback from stakeholders and user testing.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Final Design -->
        <div class="process-step">
            <h4>5. Final Design</h4>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>After refining the designs, we finalized the visual elements and created high-fidelity mockups. The final design reflects a minimalist aesthetic, with soothing colors and clear typography to enhance the user experience. Below is a preview of the final design for the Clear Path app.</p>
            </div>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <div class="section-content">
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>The design process for Clear Path was a journey of collaboration, research, and iteration. By focusing on user needs and ensuring ease of use, we aimed to create an app that provides real value in managing mental health. We're proud of the result, and we believe the Clear Path app will make a positive impact on users' mental wellness journeys.</p>
